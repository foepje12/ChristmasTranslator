# How to play
After clicking start you will see a word you have to translate. The first time you get a translation, the correct answer will be show above it. If you don’t know a translation, you can click on the sentence to be translated and the answer will be shown above.

On the right is a count down, when it reaches zero you lose. Increase it by getting correct answers. Getting answers wrong will decrease the timer. NOTE: accents are NOT required. Example: when asked to type Noël, noel will be fine. Capitals are also not required.

Every time you translate a word/sentence it will decrease the score you get from it the next time. For example: if you get 0.5 seconds from translating the word Snowman, the next time that particular translation comes up it will only grant you 0.4 seconds. That’s where the elves come in. If you’re running out of time you can choose to sacrifice an elf, giving you a full time bar. But beware, because the translations are also getting harder.

Last Note: The game is absolutely not balanced in any way, so please keep that in mind.
